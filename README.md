# Marvel-Character-Sheets

This project is meant to create a web application that will allow users to make and save character sheets for the Marvel TTRPG.
It will be a proof of concept that I want to build into a desktop application using Electron.js at a later date.

## Roadmap
1. Build HTML
- Hub with list of user's character sheets
- Pages for each character sheet
2. Apply Styles
3. Add Functionality

- Saving character sheets for later use
